Welcome to learning R! We're going to start out with the basics. This file will guide you through your introduction to R.

# How does R _work_?

R is a high level programming language. It's built on lower level programming languages like C++. 

It's _high level_ which means there's a lot of functionality built in to make life easier on the programmer.

Most people use R in an _integrated development environment (IDE)_. The most popular of these is RStudio. The advantage of an IDE is that there is alot of built in tools and functionality to make life easier as a programmer.

You'll note we talk alot about _ease_. That's because I, personally, am lazy.

# Introducing the IDE

Since you will most likely be using R in the IDE, let's introduce it to you to start with.

There are four main windows in the RStudio IDE, though there are others.

Let's start by trying out the console. Try typing `2 + 3` in the console window, hit enter.

![Using the console](./images/console.png)

What happens? Good. You've just discovered that R is your new desktop calculator.

Let's create a new R script, where we can record and write large amounts of code.

![New R script](./images/new r script.png)

Let's put some code in it now.

Try putting in `x <- 2 + 3`, then saving your file.

Highlight the code and press `command + enter` and check the environment window.

Congratulations, you've run your first script!

# Where do things live in R?

Finding where things _are_ can be a real challenge when learning a new programming language and IDE.

# R lives and breathes _packages_

The real power of R is a world wide community of developers, nerds and enthusiasts who are constantly writing new packages - chunks of code that you can reuse for you own purpose.

There are many places these packages can be retrieved from, but one of those places is Github. The package that generates this document is in a github repository and you can download it.

Copy the following code into the console: this downloads the package. You only need to do this once.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stephdesilva/getStarted")
```

Now to load the package into the environment, type this:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(getStarted)
```

You've now got this package and the code that generates this document on your computer.

# Time to get some data

Getting data into R the first time can be tricky, so this package has a simple function to get us some data to start with.

Open a new script and type, highlight and press `command/control + enter`.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
db <- getWitchData()
```

Check out the environment window - do you see db? Click on it.

This is a data frame. A data frame is one of many types of data structures in R.

There's _homogenous data structures_:

![Data structures in R](./images/Atomic data structures.png)

There are also _heterogeneous data structures_, and a dataframe like `db` is one of these:

![Heterogeneous data structures in R](./images/Atomic data structures 2.png)

The data frame `db` has 12 variables. Variables are very similar to variables in SAS.

# Starting a data analysis

One of the main things you'll want to use R for is data analysis. Let's use `db` to do a simple data analysis. 

Let's start by seeing what's inside `db`.

The top rows:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
head(db)
```

The bottom rows:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
tail(db)
```

Summarise the data quickly:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
summary(db)
```

There's a really useful package called `skimr` which helps you see your data very quickly and efficiently. To get it, we install it first, then load it into the library.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
install.packages("skimr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org") # you only need to do this the first 
```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("skimr") # you only need to do this the first time you load a package
```

Now to load it into the environment:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(skimr) # you need to do this every time.
```

Then we use the function we want to skim the data:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
skim(db) # the function we want
```

What do we now know about our data?
